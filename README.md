# Factory-for-making-Pacman- In this assigment Factory for making pacmen
I was given a starter.html code.
When button "make one" is pressed I needed to complete the code 
to position the new pacman image and add it to the "game" div. It is then added to the array of pacmen, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each pacman.
I also need to make each pacman bounce off any wall it hits.
